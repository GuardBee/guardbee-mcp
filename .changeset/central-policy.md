Central policy from the GuardBee dashboard.

guard-core: `gatewayPolicySchema`, `policyShape` and `validatePolicy` describe the gateway policy document (labels, rules, taint, approval, defaults, interceptors). security-proxy builds its YAML schema from them, and the dashboard validates an edit with the same schema before saving it. guard-core now depends on zod.

security-proxy: `policy: { source: dashboard, refreshSeconds }` (needs `audit.dashboard`) takes the policy from the workspace policy in the dashboard. Upstreams, listen and audit stay local. The proxy fetches it at start and re-checks it with an ETag; an update applies to the next call in every session. With no dashboard policy, an unreachable dashboard or an invalid document it keeps the local or last good policy. Approval settings are now read per request, so a policy update changes them mid-session too.
