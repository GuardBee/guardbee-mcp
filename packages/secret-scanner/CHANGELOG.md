## 0.2.13

### Patch Changes

- [#42](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/pull/42) [`033dbda`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/033dbda55671b1589fcd2afb0344314fa420ff00) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - MCP Registry name moves to `io.github.GuardBee/<server>` (`mcpName`), so the Release workflow can publish it to the registry with GitHub OIDC on every release. Earlier versions stay listed under `io.github.4hmetuyar/<server>`.

## 0.2.8

### Patch Changes

- Shared detectors: one injection rule set, provider secrets, Turkish identifiers.
  
  guard-core
  - `INJECTION_RULES`: the prompt-injection-scanner rules and the security-proxy 0.x phrases in one list (27 rules). New: Turkish instruction override and prompt extraction, `DAN mode`, "bypass safety/guardrails", `<system>` tags, Unicode tag-character smuggling (flag emoji excluded), bidi control characters. `findInjections` also decodes base64 runs that turn into readable text and checks them.
  - Each rule is precise or `broad`. `scanForPromptInjection` blocks only on a precise high/critical rule and warns on the rest.
  - `SECRET_RULES`: the secret-scanner provider formats, moved here.
  - PII masking now covers private key blocks (whole BEGIN…END), connection strings with passwords, 22 provider key and token formats, and VKN (check digit plus a `VKN` / `Vergi No` label). Phone numbers must have a Turkish mobile, landline or 850 code and a +90 / 0 prefix or space/dash grouping, and must not sit inside a URL or id; the generic API-key rule needs a separator and both letters and digits (`tokenization1234567890ab` is no longer masked).
  - New validators: `isValidVkn`, `isValidTrPhone`.
  
  security-proxy
  - Uses the shared rules. A generic phrase alone ("act as", "you are now", "developer mode", "jailbreak", "override policy") now warns instead of blocking; in 1.0 a tool result saying "act as a reverse proxy" was blocked.
  - Masks provider keys, private keys, connection strings and VKN. A 10-digit number that cannot be a Turkish phone number is no longer masked as one, and no longer marks the session as holding sensitive data.
  
  prompt-injection-scanner: 17 rules instead of 10 (the precise ones from guard-core). The HTML-comment and CSS-hidden rules no longer fire on `<!-- prettier-ignore -->`, on a comment that merely mentions "instructions", or on `background-color: white`: they now need instruction-like language ("ignore all/the/previous …", "system prompt", "AI:"). Measured on 1,610 package READMEs, blocking findings went from 20 files to 0.
  
  secret-scanner: rules now come from guard-core; no change in what it reports.

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- [#4](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/pull/4) [`72a8129`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/72a81293820c7d41047bca38ccc25ed6fa676297) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - Fix MCP contracts that disagreed with the implementation: dependency-auditor no longer claims Cargo manifest scanning and parses npm lockfile names, PEP 621 pyproject files, and CVSS vectors; rug-pull `--no-auto-baseline` does not report a baseline it did not save; the security proxy honors warn mode and `PROXY_*` settings; scanners reject a non-positive `maxFiles` and document exclude entries as path substrings. `@guardbee/mcp-telemetry` now has a CommonJS export so the CommonJS `db-gateway` and `security-proxy` binaries can load it.
- Updated dependencies [[`72a8129`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/72a81293820c7d41047bca38ccc25ed6fa676297)]:
  - @guardbee/mcp-telemetry@0.1.3

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix each package's `repository` field to point at the actual monorepo (`github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp`) with a `directory` pointing at its own subfolder. 9 packages still pointed at their old, now-archived standalone repos from before the 2026-09-11 monorepo migration (never updated); the 4 packages added since then pointed at the right repo but were missing `directory`. This mattered in practice, not just cosmetically: npm rewrites relative README links (e.g. the `TR.md` language-switcher link) using `repository.url` + `repository.directory`, so every package's Turkish-README link on npmjs.com was resolving to either a 404 (wrong/archived repo) or the wrong path (repo root instead of the package's subfolder). Also fixes `db-gateway`'s and `security-proxy`'s stale `bugs.url` and `db-gateway`'s stale `homepage`, and the same stale repository URL in `db-gateway/manifest.json`.

  - @guardbee/mcp-telemetry@0.1.2

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Make English the primary `README.md` (what npm and GitHub display by default) for every package, matching the change already made for `db-gateway`. The previous Turkish content moves to `TR.md`, linked via a language switcher at the top of both files. Docs-only change, no code/behavior changes.
- Updated dependencies []:
  - @guardbee/mcp-telemetry@0.1.1

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`8115d23`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/8115d2343190febb3fa7101f5edec142c0b80967) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - Add usage telemetry via the new `@guardbee/mcp-telemetry` shared package — **on by default**, disable with `GUARDBEE_TELEMETRY=0`. Every tool call reports the tool name, a shape-preserving-redacted version of its parameters, success/failure, and duration to `app.guardbee.ai`.
  
  Redaction (`redactParams`, see `@guardbee/mcp-telemetry`'s README) replaces any string longer than 40 characters, and the value of any `content`/`text`/`data`/`filter`/`password`/`email`/`apiKey`/`token`/`secret` key regardless of length, with a `"[redacted: ...]"` placeholder — full file/scan content and real row data are never sent, only short structural parameters like table names or limits. A one-time notice is printed to stderr on first use explaining this and how to opt out. This is a behavior change (these packages now make an outbound network call by default) — previously most of them advertised running entirely offline.

### Patch Changes

- [`64eb8b0`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/64eb8b0fa9425ab3b03fa9621737bda9a238519b) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - Add Smithery.ai integration files (`smithery.yaml`, `manifest.json`, `.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`), matching the pattern already used by `@guardbee/mcp-db-gateway`, so these servers are one-click installable from Smithery and discoverable via their MCP server card. No functional/runtime code changes — these files are read from the GitHub repo by Smithery, not from the published npm tarball (`package.json` `files` is unchanged).
