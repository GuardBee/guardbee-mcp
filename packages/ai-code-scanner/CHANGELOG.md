# @guardbee/mcp-ai-code-scanner

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- [#177](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/pull/177) [`ee8718b`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/ee8718b0ab9a169473a365818089f84c6b1080b7) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - Source scans now see tools registered with `server.registerTool("name", { description, inputSchema }, handler)`, the MCP TypeScript SDK's current form, not only the deprecated `server.tool(...)`. Before, a server written with `registerTool` got no findings from these rules: toxic-flow-auditor's lethal-trifecta check, tool-poisoning-scanner's description and parameter checks (the description is read from the config object), mcp-server-auditor's shell-tool-name and `z.any()` rules, audit-gap-auditor's "tools without an audit trail", unbounded-consumption-auditor's missing rate limit, and ai-code-scanner's excessive-agency tool name.

- [#178](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/pull/178) [`c89dc93`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/c89dc93bd04e53bc8b72806f279531676b8defcc) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - MCP tools are registered with `server.registerTool(name, { description, inputSchema, annotations }, handler)` instead of the deprecated `server.tool(...)` (132 registrations, no change to tool names, descriptions or parameters). `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` is now required at `^1.30.0` instead of `^1.0.0` / `>=1.0.0`, so an install cannot resolve an old SDK the code was never tested with. `@guardbee/mcp-telemetry`'s `instrumentServer` wraps `registerTool` as well as `tool`.

- [#175](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/pull/175) [`341a283`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/341a2839d56a312f1cb1998a523eb7ea985345db) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - Smaller npm packages (55% less unpacked in total; the proxy 944 → 513 kB): source maps and compiled tests are no longer published (the sources they point at never were), and the translated READMEs stay on GitHub, linked from the English one. Package descriptions now start with what people search for ("MCP gateway and LLM firewall", "Secret scanner for code, git history and AI agent transcripts") and carry more search keywords.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#172](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/pull/172) [`9ae575f`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/9ae575f89aa40b13463460504f12b70011c14947) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - `security-suite` now covers every GuardBee scanner and auditor (29 packages, 124 MCP tools). `guardbee serve` serves the recommended group by default (owasp-scan, secret-scanner, prompt-injection-scanner, toxic-flow-auditor, mcp-config-auditor, dependency-auditor: 31 tools); `--tools=` (or `GUARDBEE_SUITE_TOOLS`) takes groups (`code`, `supply-chain`, `network`, `platform`, `all`) and package ids. Tool names carry their package's prefix (`secrets_scan_text`, `injection_scan_text`) so packages do not collide. `guardbee <package-id> <args>` runs any package's CLI and `guardbee list` lists them; the old `secret-scan`, `dep-audit`, `ssl-inspect` and `dns-check` shortcuts still work. With no arguments and no terminal on stdin (an MCP client starting it), the suite now serves instead of printing help, and its MCP Registry entry passes `serve`.
  
  **Breaking for `guardbee serve` users:** the five plain tool names (`scan_directory`, `scan_file`, `audit_dependencies`, `inspect_ssl`, `check_dns`) are now prefixed package tools; see "Upgrading from 0.2" in the README.
  
  Every scanner and auditor package exports `registerTools(server)`, which registers its MCP tools on a given `McpServer`; `startServer()` uses it.

### Patch Changes

- [#170](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/pull/170) [`c71f728`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/c71f7284c88f36435d0b2f951d5f167781f89395) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - Package hygiene: every package now ships its LICENSE and CHANGELOG.md, and has a homepage (its guardbee.ai page), a bugs link, `engines.node` and the `guardbee`, `mcp` and `security` keywords. READMEs gain npm badges and a feedback section pointing to GitHub Discussions; the owasp-scan README documents every mode, option, MCP tool and the OWASP coverage.
  
  **Telemetry is now opt-in.** Nothing is sent unless `GUARDBEE_TELEMETRY=1` (or `true`/`on`/`yes`) is set; `GUARDBEE_TELEMETRY=0` is no longer needed. When it is on, the one-time stderr notice says what is sent and to which endpoint.

### Patch Changes

- [#4](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/pull/4) [`72a8129`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/72a81293820c7d41047bca38ccc25ed6fa676297) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - Fix MCP contracts that disagreed with the implementation: dependency-auditor no longer claims Cargo manifest scanning and parses npm lockfile names, PEP 621 pyproject files, and CVSS vectors; rug-pull `--no-auto-baseline` does not report a baseline it did not save; the security proxy honors warn mode and `PROXY_*` settings; scanners reject a non-positive `maxFiles` and document exclude entries as path substrings. `@guardbee/mcp-telemetry` now has a CommonJS export so the CommonJS `db-gateway` and `security-proxy` binaries can load it.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix each package's `repository` field to point at the actual monorepo (`github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp`) with a `directory` pointing at its own subfolder. 9 packages still pointed at their old, now-archived standalone repos from before the 2026-09-11 monorepo migration (never updated); the 4 packages added since then pointed at the right repo but were missing `directory`. This mattered in practice, not just cosmetically: npm rewrites relative README links (e.g. the `TR.md` language-switcher link) using `repository.url` + `repository.directory`, so every package's Turkish-README link on npmjs.com was resolving to either a 404 (wrong/archived repo) or the wrong path (repo root instead of the package's subfolder). Also fixes `db-gateway`'s and `security-proxy`'s stale `bugs.url` and `db-gateway`'s stale `homepage`, and the same stale repository URL in `db-gateway/manifest.json`.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Make English the primary `README.md` (what npm and GitHub display by default) for every package, matching the change already made for `db-gateway`. The previous Turkish content moves to `TR.md`, linked via a language switcher at the top of both files. Docs-only change, no code/behavior changes.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`8115d23`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/8115d2343190febb3fa7101f5edec142c0b80967) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - Add usage telemetry via the new `@guardbee/mcp-telemetry` shared package — **on by default**, disable with `GUARDBEE_TELEMETRY=0`. Every tool call reports the tool name, a shape-preserving-redacted version of its parameters, success/failure, and duration to `app.guardbee.ai`.
  
  Redaction (`redactParams`, see `@guardbee/mcp-telemetry`'s README) replaces any string longer than 40 characters, and the value of any `content`/`text`/`data`/`filter`/`password`/`email`/`apiKey`/`token`/`secret` key regardless of length, with a `"[redacted: ...]"` placeholder — full file/scan content and real row data are never sent, only short structural parameters like table names or limits. A one-time notice is printed to stderr on first use explaining this and how to opt out. This is a behavior change (these packages now make an outbound network call by default) — previously most of them advertised running entirely offline.
