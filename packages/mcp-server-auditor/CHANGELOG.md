## 0.1.8

### Patch Changes

- [#42](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/pull/42) [`033dbda`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/033dbda55671b1589fcd2afb0344314fa420ff00) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - MCP Registry name moves to `io.github.GuardBee/<server>` (`mcpName`), so the Release workflow can publish it to the registry with GitHub OIDC on every release. Earlier versions stay listed under `io.github.4hmetuyar/<server>`.

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- [#38](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/pull/38) [`e8b97bb`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/e8b97bb6f3cb434b07f5660cfb9d73258581db8c) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - Ship AI-security MCP gap follow-up: unified OWASP MCP Top 10 meta-scanner (`mcp-owasp-scan`), MCP10 context-oversharing auditor, Python MCP05/OAuth patterns, and a reusable GitHub Action that uploads SARIF for toxic-flow / audit-gap / context-oversharing / owasp-scan.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- [#4](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/pull/4) [`72a8129`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/72a81293820c7d41047bca38ccc25ed6fa676297) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - Fix MCP contracts that disagreed with the implementation: dependency-auditor no longer claims Cargo manifest scanning and parses npm lockfile names, PEP 621 pyproject files, and CVSS vectors; rug-pull `--no-auto-baseline` does not report a baseline it did not save; the security proxy honors warn mode and `PROXY_*` settings; scanners reject a non-positive `maxFiles` and document exclude entries as path substrings. `@guardbee/mcp-telemetry` now has a CommonJS export so the CommonJS `db-gateway` and `security-proxy` binaries can load it.
- Updated dependencies [[`72a8129`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/72a81293820c7d41047bca38ccc25ed6fa676297)]:

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix each package's `repository` field to point at the actual monorepo (`github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp`) with a `directory` pointing at its own subfolder. 9 packages still pointed at their old, now-archived standalone repos from before the 2026-09-11 monorepo migration (never updated); the 4 packages added since then pointed at the right repo but were missing `directory`. This mattered in practice, not just cosmetically: npm rewrites relative README links (e.g. the `TR.md` language-switcher link) using `repository.url` + `repository.directory`, so every package's Turkish-README link on npmjs.com was resolving to either a 404 (wrong/archived repo) or the wrong path (repo root instead of the package's subfolder). Also fixes `db-gateway`'s and `security-proxy`'s stale `bugs.url` and `db-gateway`'s stale `homepage`, and the same stale repository URL in `db-gateway/manifest.json`.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Make English the primary `README.md` (what npm and GitHub display by default) for every package, matching the change already made for `db-gateway`. The previous Turkish content moves to `TR.md`, linked via a language switcher at the top of both files. Docs-only change, no code/behavior changes.
