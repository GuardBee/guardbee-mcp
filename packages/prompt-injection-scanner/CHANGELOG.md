## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Shared detectors: one injection rule set, provider secrets, Turkish identifiers.
  
  guard-core
  - `INJECTION_RULES`: the prompt-injection-scanner rules and the security-proxy 0.x phrases in one list (27 rules). New: Turkish instruction override and prompt extraction, `DAN mode`, "bypass safety/guardrails", `<system>` tags, Unicode tag-character smuggling (flag emoji excluded), bidi control characters. `findInjections` also decodes base64 runs that turn into readable text and checks them.
  - Each rule is precise or `broad`. `scanForPromptInjection` blocks only on a precise high/critical rule and warns on the rest.
  - `SECRET_RULES`: the secret-scanner provider formats, moved here.
  - PII masking now covers private key blocks (whole BEGIN…END), connection strings with passwords, 22 provider key and token formats, and VKN (check digit plus a `VKN` / `Vergi No` label). Phone numbers must have a Turkish mobile, landline or 850 code and a +90 / 0 prefix or space/dash grouping, and must not sit inside a URL or id; the generic API-key rule needs a separator and both letters and digits (`tokenization1234567890ab` is no longer masked).
  - New validators: `isValidVkn`, `isValidTrPhone`.
  
  security-proxy
  - Uses the shared rules. A generic phrase alone ("act as", "you are now", "developer mode", "jailbreak", "override policy") now warns instead of blocking; in 1.0 a tool result saying "act as a reverse proxy" was blocked.
  - Masks provider keys, private keys, connection strings and VKN. A 10-digit number that cannot be a Turkish phone number is no longer masked as one, and no longer marks the session as holding sensitive data.
  
  prompt-injection-scanner: 17 rules instead of 10 (the precise ones from guard-core). The HTML-comment and CSS-hidden rules no longer fire on `<!-- prettier-ignore -->`, on a comment that merely mentions "instructions", or on `background-color: white`: they now need instruction-like language ("ignore all/the/previous …", "system prompt", "AI:"). Measured on 1,610 package READMEs, blocking findings went from 20 files to 0.
  
  secret-scanner: rules now come from guard-core; no change in what it reports.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- [#4](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/pull/4) [`72a8129`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/72a81293820c7d41047bca38ccc25ed6fa676297) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - Fix MCP contracts that disagreed with the implementation: dependency-auditor no longer claims Cargo manifest scanning and parses npm lockfile names, PEP 621 pyproject files, and CVSS vectors; rug-pull `--no-auto-baseline` does not report a baseline it did not save; the security proxy honors warn mode and `PROXY_*` settings; scanners reject a non-positive `maxFiles` and document exclude entries as path substrings. `@guardbee/mcp-telemetry` now has a CommonJS export so the CommonJS `db-gateway` and `security-proxy` binaries can load it.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix each package's `repository` field to point at the actual monorepo (`github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp`) with a `directory` pointing at its own subfolder. 9 packages still pointed at their old, now-archived standalone repos from before the 2026-09-11 monorepo migration (never updated); the 4 packages added since then pointed at the right repo but were missing `directory`. This mattered in practice, not just cosmetically: npm rewrites relative README links (e.g. the `TR.md` language-switcher link) using `repository.url` + `repository.directory`, so every package's Turkish-README link on npmjs.com was resolving to either a 404 (wrong/archived repo) or the wrong path (repo root instead of the package's subfolder). Also fixes `db-gateway`'s and `security-proxy`'s stale `bugs.url` and `db-gateway`'s stale `homepage`, and the same stale repository URL in `db-gateway/manifest.json`.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Make English the primary `README.md` (what npm and GitHub display by default) for every package, matching the change already made for `db-gateway`. The previous Turkish content moves to `TR.md`, linked via a language switcher at the top of both files. Docs-only change, no code/behavior changes.
