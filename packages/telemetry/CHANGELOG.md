# @guardbee/mcp-telemetry

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#178](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/pull/178) [`c89dc93`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/c89dc93bd04e53bc8b72806f279531676b8defcc) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - MCP tools are registered with `server.registerTool(name, { description, inputSchema, annotations }, handler)` instead of the deprecated `server.tool(...)` (132 registrations, no change to tool names, descriptions or parameters). `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` is now required at `^1.30.0` instead of `^1.0.0` / `>=1.0.0`, so an install cannot resolve an old SDK the code was never tested with. `@guardbee/mcp-telemetry`'s `instrumentServer` wraps `registerTool` as well as `tool`.

### Patch Changes

- [#185](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/pull/185) [`12487ab`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/12487abec2f0a8bc00b04fee1f8b62e64329c98b) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - `mcp-security-proxy` and `mcp-db-gateway` get an `exports` map (the package root, `./dist/*` for existing deep imports, `package.json`); db-gateway also exports `./adapters/*`, so the documented `import { createPrismaAdapter } from "@guardbee/mcp-db-gateway/adapters/prisma"` now resolves. The proxy moves to ldapts 9 (its older uuid had an advisory). The telemetry package description now says opt-in, the suite's starts with "MCP security suite", and document-scanner's homepage is its README.

- [#175](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/pull/175) [`341a283`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/341a2839d56a312f1cb1998a523eb7ea985345db) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - Smaller npm packages (55% less unpacked in total; the proxy 944 → 513 kB): source maps and compiled tests are no longer published (the sources they point at never were), and the translated READMEs stay on GitHub, linked from the English one. Package descriptions now start with what people search for ("MCP gateway and LLM firewall", "Secret scanner for code, git history and AI agent transcripts") and carry more search keywords.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#170](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/pull/170) [`c71f728`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/c71f7284c88f36435d0b2f951d5f167781f89395) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - Package hygiene: every package now ships its LICENSE and CHANGELOG.md, and has a homepage (its guardbee.ai page), a bugs link, `engines.node` and the `guardbee`, `mcp` and `security` keywords. READMEs gain npm badges and a feedback section pointing to GitHub Discussions; the owasp-scan README documents every mode, option, MCP tool and the OWASP coverage.
  
  **Telemetry is now opt-in.** Nothing is sent unless `GUARDBEE_TELEMETRY=1` (or `true`/`on`/`yes`) is set; `GUARDBEE_TELEMETRY=0` is no longer needed. When it is on, the one-time stderr notice says what is sent and to which endpoint.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- [#75](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/pull/75) [`f3b785f`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/f3b785fe9454f80720ec36468fee9f5b2e9a70ed) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - docs: add Chinese (ZH) README translation and short summaries in Japanese, Korean, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish and German (JA.md, KO.md, PT-BR.md, ES.md, DE.md), with an eight-language switcher

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- [#4](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/pull/4) [`72a8129`](https://github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp/commit/72a81293820c7d41047bca38ccc25ed6fa676297) Thanks [@4hmetuyar](https://github.com/4hmetuyar)! - Fix MCP contracts that disagreed with the implementation: dependency-auditor no longer claims Cargo manifest scanning and parses npm lockfile names, PEP 621 pyproject files, and CVSS vectors; rug-pull `--no-auto-baseline` does not report a baseline it did not save; the security proxy honors warn mode and `PROXY_*` settings; scanners reject a non-positive `maxFiles` and document exclude entries as path substrings. `@guardbee/mcp-telemetry` now has a CommonJS export so the CommonJS `db-gateway` and `security-proxy` binaries can load it.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix each package's `repository` field to point at the actual monorepo (`github.com/GuardBee/guardbee-mcp`) with a `directory` pointing at its own subfolder. 9 packages still pointed at their old, now-archived standalone repos from before the 2026-09-11 monorepo migration (never updated); the 4 packages added since then pointed at the right repo but were missing `directory`. This mattered in practice, not just cosmetically: npm rewrites relative README links (e.g. the `TR.md` language-switcher link) using `repository.url` + `repository.directory`, so every package's Turkish-README link on npmjs.com was resolving to either a 404 (wrong/archived repo) or the wrong path (repo root instead of the package's subfolder). Also fixes `db-gateway`'s and `security-proxy`'s stale `bugs.url` and `db-gateway`'s stale `homepage`, and the same stale repository URL in `db-gateway/manifest.json`.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Make English the primary `README.md` (what npm and GitHub display by default) for every package, matching the change already made for `db-gateway`. The previous Turkish content moves to `TR.md`, linked via a language switcher at the top of both files. Docs-only change, no code/behavior changes.
